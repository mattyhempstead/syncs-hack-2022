Setting up the app for local development
==========================================

1. Make a Canva app:
Follow https://docs.developer.canva.com/apps/quick-start
I chose your team can use the app, edit images option, remote image processing extension.

2. Follow the editing extension quick start guide: https://docs.developer.canva.com/apps/extensions/editing-extensions/quick-start (if u want low key unnecessary)

3. Follow https://docs.developer.canva.com/apps/frontend-development/development-url/development-url-javascript to set it up so u can just edit the javascript files and refresh instead of having to reload stuff

4. Follow https://docs.developer.canva.com/apps/frontend-development/development-url/development-url-https so ur server can self sign with ssh and stuff so it will actually load
